According to the website iPrice, <b>TikTok</b> was the most downloaded entertainment app in the Philippines’ iOS App Store as of 2020. Besides delighting users with addictive short-form videos, the app has significantly grown online search interest in products which have been featured in viral clips. For instance, Google Trends reported a 1329% surge in interest for Ocean Spray’s cran-raspberry juice after being featured in an American TikTok user’s unsponsored video <i><a href="https://www.onenews.ph/tiktok-still-the-most-downloaded-entertainment-app-in-phl-retains-global-popularity-despite-controversies">(Mateo, 2020)</a></i>. Hence, both local and foreign brands have increasingly turned to the platform as a content marketing tool.
<br><br>
However, several limitations prevent local marketers from fully benefiting from the influence of TikTokers.
<br> 

1.   There are <b>limited platforms</b> which track the performance of TikTok influencers in the Philippines. To the knowledge of our team, the only websites which provide data on local TikTokers are Influence Grid and Hypetrace. <br>
2.   The aforementioned websites merely classify influencers based on metrics such as followers, likes, views, and average engagement. They do not provide insight into <b>other characteristics of trending videos</b>, such as the optimal publishing schedule, music, text, and visual elements used by influencers. <br>
3.   By relying on the influencer rankings published by existing platforms, which are largely based on past engagement rates, marketers may be <b>late in identifying up-and-coming influencers</b> who may have greater growth potential than top influencers who may have already reached the peaks of their careers.
<br>

So, how can local marketers better leverage TikTokers’ huge online influence to drive the growth of their brands?
