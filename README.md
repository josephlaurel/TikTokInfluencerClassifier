## <b> Background </b>
<p align='justify'>
According to the website iPrice, <b>TikTok</b> was the most downloaded entertainment app in the Philippines’ iOS App Store as of 2020. Besides delighting users with addictive short-form videos, the app has significantly grown online search interest in products which have been featured in viral clips. For instance, Google Trends reported a 1329% surge in interest for Ocean Spray’s cran-raspberry juice after being featured in an American TikTok user’s unsponsored video <i><a href="https://www.onenews.ph/tiktok-still-the-most-downloaded-entertainment-app-in-phl-retains-global-popularity-despite-controversies">(Mateo, 2020)</a></i>. Hence, both local and foreign brands have increasingly turned to the platform as a content marketing tool.
<br><br>
However, several limitations prevent local marketers from fully benefiting from the influence of TikTokers.
<br> 

1.   There are <b>limited platforms</b> which track the performance of TikTok influencers in the Philippines. To the knowledge of our team, the only websites which provide data on local TikTokers are Influence Grid and Hypetrace. <br>
2.   The aforementioned websites merely classify influencers based on metrics such as followers, likes, views, and average engagement. They do not provide insight into <b>other characteristics of trending videos</b>, such as the optimal publishing schedule, music, text, and visual elements used by influencers. <br>
3.   By relying on the influencer rankings published by existing platforms, which are largely based on past engagement rates, marketers may be <b>late in identifying up-and-coming influencers</b> who may have greater growth potential than top influencers who may have already reached the peaks of their careers.

So, how can local marketers better leverage TikTokers’ huge online influence to drive the growth of their brands?

## <b> Objectives </b>

To address the needs of local marketers, our project is patterned after the work of [Şimşek and Kabakus (2018)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329896342_Finding_Influencers_on_Twitter_with_Using_Machine_Learning_Classification_Algorithms) and has the following objectives:

1.   To develop a holistic <b>influencer classification algorithm</b> that considers the audio, visual and text characteristics of a trending video, the engagement on a single video, and the overall engagement on the creator's account. The model was trained and tested using 6,882 trending videos scraped between November and December 2020 using the unofficial TikTok application programming interface wrapper created by [David Teather](https://davidteather.github.io/TikTok-Api/).<br>
2.   To perform a feature importance analysis to identify <b>key features</b> that are most greatly associated with influencer-generated videos.
